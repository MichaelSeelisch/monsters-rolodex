A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/vailjoy/pen/GNbQoO.

 Using Flexbox and viewport units, we creat a fluid two column layout for a fictional shoe brand, then boost it with CSS animations and transitions to make the interactions more interesting and fun. 

Uses animate.css and fontawesome.  Photos thanks to pexels,com.

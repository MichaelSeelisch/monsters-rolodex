## Running the code

Start any http-server inside the code folder then access it through the localhost. For Node JS you can install the http-server module globally so that you should be getting the server in you command line.

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Once the installation is finished, then enter the below commands in your terminal

```
cd <codeFolder>
http-server
```

`index.html` should be serving at `http://localhost:8080`
